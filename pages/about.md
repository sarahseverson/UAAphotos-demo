## About this collection 
This collection of archival photographs depicts life and activities at the University of Alberta and surrounding communities. It is a small sample of the over 200,000 photographs currently housed in the University of Alberta Archives. 

These photographs have been arranged into the collection to facilitate online access by researchers and the general public. They originate from different fonds and were created by various individuals, organizations, or university units. If you would like to learn about the context of their creation or other records related to the photographs available at the UAA, [contact us](https://library.ualberta.ca/archives/contact] with a link to the item you are interested in.
